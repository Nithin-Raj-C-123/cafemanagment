☕ Nithin Café Management System
📌 Project Description

Nithin Café Management System is a modern, web-based café ordering and billing application designed to simplify day-to-day café operations.
The system allows an admin to securely log in, manage menu items across multiple categories, take customer orders, generate bills, handle multiple payment methods (online & offline), and contribute a fixed charity amount per order.
